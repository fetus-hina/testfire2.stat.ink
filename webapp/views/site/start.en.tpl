    <h2>
      How do I make my Splat Log?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are two ways to make your Splatoon play log. The first option is having a program like Ikalog do it automatically, and the another option is entering the data manually.
    </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
        <h3>
          Automatic Mode (Recommended)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Use a Splatoon data collection program, such as <a href="https://github.com/hasegaw/IkaLog/wiki/en_Home">IkaLog</a>, to analyze your gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>
          IkaLog analyzes your gameplay by monitoring the video output from Wii U console. The diagram below describes how it all works:
        </p>
        <img src="{{$app->assetmanager->getAssetUrl($aboutAsset, 'overview.en.png')|escape}}" alt="" title="" style="width:100%;max-width:530px">
        <p>
          If the application is set up correctly, all of your Splatoon gameplay will be analyzed, and helpful data will be submitted to your stat.ink account automatically.&#32;
          You can benefit from all of stat.ink's features in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't already have an HDMI capture card, like an AverMedia or Elgato, you will need to get one.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some HDMI capture devices (e.g. AverMedia AVT-C875 and Intensity Shuttle) have a built in HDMI splitter.&#32;
            In this case, you won't need to buy a splitter separately.&#32;
            Otherwise, you will need a splitter so you can connect the Wii U's output to both your TV and the capture device.
          </li>
          <li>
            720p must be supported by the capture device.
          </li>
          <li>
            IkaLog doesn't work with some HDMI captures device, due to compatibility issues (e.g. inaccurate/poor image quality or incompatible driver software).&#32;
            It is strongly suggested to check the <a href="https://github.com/hasegaw/IkaLog/wiki/en_CaptureDevices">"reported HDMI devices" list on the IkaLog wiki</a> if you are going to buy one.&#32;
            Elgato capture cards will not work directly with IkaLog, so if you have one, you'll have to use the screen capture method. <!--detailed on the GitHub wiki below.-->

          It's quite simple; you can input the battle results manually.&#32;
          Since you have oly a few seconds to view the scoreboard, you are able to fill a few details about the match (e.g. stage, mode, your weapon, and win/defeat).
